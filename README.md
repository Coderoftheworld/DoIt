# DoIt
A simple to-do list app made in react native

Planned features include:
* Reminders (push notifs or email)
* List settings
* Sync with website version (when made)
* Speech to text 
* Pencil support (ex: Apple Pencil)
* Customizable UI

And whatever I come up with while programming this

Enjoy :)
